    <h2 style="text-align: left;color: rgb(223, 105, 255);text-transform: uppercase;font-style: oblique;font-weight: bolder;">Character Design</h2>
    <p>After first images of She-Ra's design were released in July 2018, controversy ensued on social media.<br>
    Some Internet users contended that she was not as "beautiful and sexy", voluptuous or glamorous as<br>
    in the original series, or that she looked like a boy. Other users responded that the new series tried to avoid<br>
    sexualizing a children's show, and conveyed body positivity.<br><br>Below is the old She-Ra vs the new She-Ra</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;color: rgb(115, 105, 255);text-transform: uppercase;font-style: oblique;font-weight: bolder;">Themes</h2>
    <p>According to the creator of the show, Stevenson, the show's thematic core is the relationships among its characters, which range from<br>
        "wide-eyed love" to "heart-rending jealousy, crushes and infatuations". Reviewers particularly highlighted the convincing portrayal<br>
        of the anti-hero Catra and her complicated "frenemy" relationship with Adora,which The Verge described as "the best animated<br>
        antihero story since Avatar: The Last Airbender's Zuko". In addition, the series addresses such themes as abusive relationships and,<br>
        overcoming trauma,prejudice, isolationism (as exemplified, initially, by the princesses), colonization, imperialism, and genocide<br>
        (a result of Hordak's planetary-scale warfare). There is a strong focus on the struggle to break free of sociopolitical indoctrination,<br>
        explored mainly through the stories of Adora, Hordak, and Light Hope. </p>
